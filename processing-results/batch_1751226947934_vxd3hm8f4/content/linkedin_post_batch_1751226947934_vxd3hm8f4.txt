==================================================

==================================================
I'm a professional content creator specializing in {template_name}s. I've been provided with the following data:
```
{json.dumps(content_summary, indent=2)}
```
And the following vocabularies:
```
{json.dumps(all_vocabularies, indent=2)}
```
The source nanopublications are:
`{'.join(sources)}`
Citation information is:
`{citation_info}`
My task is to create content based on the prompt template:
`{template.prompt_template.format(user_instructions=user_instructions)}`
According to the structure requirements, my content should follow this format:
```
{template.structure}
```
I've been given guidelines for creating the content:
`{guidelines_text}`
Critical requirements for me are:
* Only use facts, claims, and information that are explicitly stated in the provided data.
* Do not invent statistics, percentages, or specific numbers that are not in the source data.
* If I mention specific claims, they must be directly traceable to the provided nanopublications.
* When referencing findings, use general language like "research shows", "studies indicate", "evidence suggests" rather than inventing specific metrics.
* Maximum length: {template.max_length} characters.
* Style: {template.style_guidelines}
Fact-checking requirements are:
* Before writing any specific statistic, percentage, or number, verify it exists in the provided data.
* If I cannot find a specific claim in the data, express it in general terms.
* Example: Instead of "reduces time by 90%" say "significantly reduces time".
* Example: Instead of "improves efficiency by 50%" say "improves efficiency".
* When in doubt, be conservative and factual rather than specific and potentially incorrect.
I will remember that accuracy is more important than engagement. I will not fabricate data.
